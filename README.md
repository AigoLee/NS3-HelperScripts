## NS3 Helper Scripts
* You can find scripts I use to help me run my `ns3` simulations in the directory `ns3helpers`

* There's a `README.md` under that directory with information on how to use the scripts.

## `ns3` Examples
Under the `examples` directory we have `ns3` project directories that you can run by copying them to your `ns3`'s scratch directory
